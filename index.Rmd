# About this notebook {-}

這本筆記本是我讀完[**R for Data Science**](https://r4ds.had.co.nz)這本書後所嘗試使用`bookdown`所做的練習、以及這本書中練習題的解法。其中也參考了[**R Markdown: The Definitive Guide**](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)和[**bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown**](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/)這兩本書。

This notebook is my practice after reading those books:

- [**R for Data Science**](https://r4ds.had.co.nz)
- [**R Markdown: The Definitive Guide**](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)
- [**bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown**](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/)
