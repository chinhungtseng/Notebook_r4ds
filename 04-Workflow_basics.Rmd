# Workflow: basics

```{r tidyverse ,include=FALSE}
if (!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

## Practice {-}

1. Why does this code not work?
    ```{r, error = TRUE}
    my_variable <- 10
    my_varıable
    ```
    
    Look carefully! (This may seem like an exercise in pointlessness, but
    training your brain to notice even the tiniest difference will pay off
    when programming.)
    
   > not my_var ı able, instead is my_var i able.
    
1. Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly:
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    library(tidyverse)
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
    
    fliter(mpg, cyl = 8)
    filter(diamond, carat > 3)
    ```
    ```{r}
    filter(mpg, cyl == 8)
    filter(diamonds, carat > 3)
    ```
    
1. Press Alt + Shift + K. What happens? How can you get to the same place
   using the menus?
